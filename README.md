# Animal Factory

This project demonstrates the Factory Design Pattern by implementing an Animal Factory that generates different
animals based on user input. Each animal has a unique sound and belongs to a specific category (Mammal, Reptile, Amphibian, etc.).

## Objective

Understand and apply the Factory Pattern to manage object creation.
Learn how to use interfaces and polymorphism to handle different objects dynamically.
Categorize animals by type and extend functionality easily.

## Features

Centralized factory for creating animal objects
Each animal implements a speak() method with a unique sound
Each animal has a getType() method that categorizes it (Mammal, Reptile, etc.)
Handles invalid input gracefully

Bonus Challenges

Use Enums for animal types instead of strings.
Exception Handling for invalid inputs.
